“The property is very authentic and is away from the hustle and bustle of Dubai. The beach is clean, the service is good and staff are generally very helpful and friendly. It’s a bit old but still quite well maintained. A bit far from the city but ok the other hand it’s great if you want to have that vacation resort feel.”
“Super friendly helpful staff, great facilities and great restaurants.”
“The staff were amazing, very friendly and attentive to every need. All facilities were spotless. Breakfast spread was amazing as was food in all the restaurants.”
“We recently stayed at the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray in Dubai with my spouse, and we were absolutely blown away by the experience. Everything from the cleanliness of the hotel to the politeness and attentiveness of the staff was exceptional. We would especially like to extend our gratitude to Natasha, a member of the room service team. She went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and was incredibly friendly throughout our visit. However, we did have one gripe that we found quite surprising. We dined at the Imperium restaurant within the hotel, where the breakfast was amazing and everything was free of charge. But when it came to dinner, we were taken aback to find out that water was not complimentary during the buffet dinner. We can understand charging for soft drinks, non-alcoholic, or alcoholic beverages, but water? Both my spouse and I found this to be quite unbelievable.”
“Amazing service and good care by Naeem. Our room was perfect. Thank you again Naeem”
