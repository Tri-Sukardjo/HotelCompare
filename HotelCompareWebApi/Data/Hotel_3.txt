“Decent, clean, friendly staff and very recommended 
Reception lady “Lana” is awesome, always serves with smile and ensure your request is will taken care of. Palm traffics tbh.”
“Great beach and swimming pool. Friendly staff. I acknowledge that this is not a hotel and they don’t service the apartment. However, for longer stays it would have been nice if they offer this every 5 days for example.”
“Excellent. No local transport, needs to get taxi”
“Very good location. Pool was clean and apartment was well equipped. Parking for our two cars was truly appreciated. Staff is so helpful and 24 hrs availability was excellent! All was perfect!”
“Large comfortable apartments fully equipped with all necessary items. Helpful receptionists. Good swimming pool with cool water (the only place outdoors to escape from the heat ☀️). Bathrobes had no waist-belts (as well as the buttons), so it was impossible to wrap over and fix the folds.”
